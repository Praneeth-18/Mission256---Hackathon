## Introduction ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to our groundbreaking Hackathon project! Here, we dive into the innovative world of AI by fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating data based on private knowledge, balancing the power of AI with the crucial importance of data privacy.

### What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? ðŸ¤–

A Large Language Model is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence capable of processing and producing text that closely mimics human language. It's trained on extensive datasets, enabling it to perform diverse language-based tasks.

### Project Objective ðŸŽ¯

Our aim is to advance this LLM to not only understand but also securely generate data rooted in private and sensitive contexts, adhering to the highest standards of privacy and ethical AI use.
